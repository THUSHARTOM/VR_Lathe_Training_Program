# VR Lathe safety training program

A basic lathe training program that was done as part of the VR AR case study at Deggendorf Institute of Technology. Runs on PC simulator currently. 

Using photogametry, we scanned the actual Lathe and imported it to blender. After polishing it up and cutting out the funtional elements, it was imported into Unity. The entire training program was made around it with beautiful terrains, a workshop with a lot of other equipments, an interactable NPC and much more.
